# Password Generator Script Documentation

This script generates a specified number of secure, URL-safe random passwords using Python's `secrets` module. The passwords are printed to the console for immediate use or copying. Below is an overview of the script and instructions on how to use it.

---

## Overview

The script leverages Python's `secrets` module to generate cryptographically secure passwords that are suitable for sensitive applications, such as user authentication tokens, API keys, or temporary passwords. Each password is generated using the `secrets.token_urlsafe()` method, ensuring it is URL-safe and contains a mix of characters for enhanced security.

## Requirements

This script requires Python 3.6 or newer, as the `secrets` module was introduced in Python 3.6.

## How It Works

1. The script begins by importing the `secrets` module.
2. It prompts the user for the number of passwords to generate.
3. Using a loop, the script generates a secure, random password for the specified number of times.
4. Each generated password is printed to the console.

## Script Walkthrough

### Importing Modules

```python
import secrets
```

The `secrets` module provides secure ways to generate cryptographic tokens. This module is particularly well-suited for generating passwords, as it uses sources of randomness designed to be cryptographically secure.

### Prompting the User

```python
password_num = int(input("Number of passwords you want to generate: "))
```

The script prompts the user to input the number of passwords they need. This input is then stored as an integer in the variable `password_num`.

### Generating Passwords

```python
for i in range(password_num):
    print(secrets.token_urlsafe())
```

The `for` loop iterates as many times as specified by the user (`password_num`). For each iteration, the script generates a password using `secrets.token_urlsafe()` and immediately prints it to the console. Each generated password:
- Is URL-safe.
- Contains a mix of alphanumeric characters and symbols.
- Has a length that is usually around 22 characters, although this may vary.

## Example Usage

When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter a number. For instance:

```
Number of passwords you want to generate: 3
```

If you enter `3`, the output will look similar to this this:

```
bB3d_T7h7O2GgK0QZT5Gbw
uQo8d5w7eR1ZXkHlNpC2OQ
kGdZVt8gHiP1OwIuRf5Ybw
```

Each of these passwords is random and secure.

## Considerations

- **Security**: Passwords are generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator, which is more suitable for security-sensitive applications than other random functions.
- **Output Length**: If you need longer passwords, you may want to modify the script to generate multiple tokens and concatenate them or adjust the length by calling `secrets.token_urlsafe(n)`, where `n` is the desired number of bytes.
