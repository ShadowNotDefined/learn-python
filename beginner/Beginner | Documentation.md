# Beginner Python Scripts Documentation

This documentation covers two beginner Python scripts that illustrate basic Python concepts like comments, printing text, and using variables.

---

## `hello-world.py`

This script demonstrates how to print text to the console, which is a common first step in learning Python. 

### Code:
```python
# This is a comment, not code. You can use comments as little notes, like this.

# This line of code uses the print() function to print the string "Hello World!"
print("Hello World!")
```

### Explanation:

- **Comments**: 
  - Comments in Python start with a `#` symbol and are ignored by the interpreter.
  - Comments are useful for adding notes or explanations to the code.

- **print() function**: 
  - The `print()` function displays text or other information to the console.
  - Here, `print("Hello World!")` will output the text `"Hello World!"` to the console.

### Expected Output:
```plaintext
Hello World!
```

## `variables.py`

This script demonstrates how to create and use variables in Python. It includes examples of an integer variable and a string variable, along with how to print each variable's value.

### Code:
```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
```

### Explanation:

- **Variables**:
  - Variables are used to store data. In Python, you do not need to declare the type of a variable; it is inferred from the value assigned.
  - `x = 5` creates an integer variable `x` with a value of `5`.
  - `y = "John"` creates a string variable `y` with a value of `"John"`.

- **print() function**:
  - `print(x)` displays the value of the variable `x` to the console.
  - `print(y)` displays the value of the variable `y` to the console.

### Expected Output:
```plaintext
5
John
```

These two scripts introduce fundamental concepts in Python and provide a solid foundation for further learning. They cover the basics of comments, printing, and variables, which are essential to understanding more complex programming concepts.

This will be updated as more projects come through.
